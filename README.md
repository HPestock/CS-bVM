# CS-bVM
Chris' Stack-based VM (That's me)

This project was created using the p5.js library found at p5js.org -- I had nothing to do with the creation or development of p5.js. 
This repository includes the github demo that can be found at hpestock.github.io and has a small change to the method of reading asm code.
